# ReaProfessor

Live-oriented REAPER theme and script pack that aims to replace **LiveProfessor 2** for live sound, theatre, and broadcast plugin hosting.

REAPER already hosts VST/VST3 (and LV2 on Linux), has deep routing, and is scriptable. ReaProfessor layers a LiveProfessor-style workflow on top:

| LiveProfessor 2 | ReaProfessor (REAPER) |
| --- | --- |
| Signal Chains | Tracks as chains + FX chain UI |
| Wire / matrix routing | Track I/O + sends + routing matrix |
| Global / plugin snapshots | ExtState snapshots + SWS snapshots |
| Cue Lists | ReaProfessor Cue List panel |
| MIDI / OSC / LTC | REAPER MIDI + OSC + script bridges |
| View Sets | Screensets + Live Mode action |
| Hardware controllers | MIDI learn / CSI / OSC maps |

## Requirements

- REAPER 7.x (Linux/macOS/Windows)
