# ReaProfessor

Live-oriented REAPER theme and script pack that aims to replace **LiveProfessor 2** for live sound, theatre, and broadcast plugin hosting.

REAPER already hosts VST/VST3 (and LV2 on Linux), has deep routing, and is scriptable. ReaProfessor layers a LiveProfessor-style workflow on top:

| LiveProfessor 2 | ReaProfessor (REAPER) |
| --- | --- |
| Signal Chains | Tracks as chains + FX chain UI |
| Wire / matrix routing | Track I/O + sends + routing matrix |
| Global / plugin snapshots | ExtState snapshots + SWS snapshots |
| Cue Lists | ReaProfessor Cue List panel |
| MIDI / OSC / LTC | REAPER MIDI + OSC + script bridges |
| View Sets | Screensets + Live Mode action |
| Hardware controllers | MIDI learn / CSI / OSC maps |

## Requirements

- REAPER 7.x (Linux/macOS/Windows)
- [SWS/S&M Extension](https://www.sws-extension.org/) (recommended)
- [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/) (recommended)

## Install (ReaPack)

```
https://github.com/JewishBidoof/reaprofessor/raw/main/index.xml
```

1. **Extensions → ReaPack → Import a repository…** → paste URL → OK  
2. **Extensions → ReaPack → Browse packages…** → filter **ReaProfessor** (category **Live**) → Install  
3. **Actions → Show action list** → search `ReaProfessor` → run **ReaProfessor**

> ReaProfessor is opened from the **Actions** list. It does **not** add an Extensions menu item — editing `reaper-menu.ini` nested ReaPack/SWS under a submenu. If a previous build did that, open the hub and click **Restore Extensions menu**.

See [docs/REAPACK.md](docs/REAPACK.md) for publishing details.



```bash
# Install REAPER + SWS + ReaPack + JACK (Linux cloud/dev)
./tools/install_dev_env.sh

# Symlink this repo into your REAPER resource path
./tools/link_to_reaper.sh

# Start dummy JACK (headless / no audio interface)
./tools/start_jack.sh

# Smoke-test scripting + extensions
./tools/smoke_test.sh
```

In REAPER: **Actions → Show action list → ReaScript: Load** →  
`Scripts/ReaProfessor/ReaProfessor.lua`

## Status

Active development (v0.4.1):

- Extensions → ReaProfessor with explicit ReaPack + SWS/S&M submenus (avoids “everything under Default menu”)
- Hub **Install / repair Extensions menu** rewrites incomplete layouts; quit/reopen once after install
- If a leftover “Default menu: Main extensions” remains: Customize menus/toolbars → uncheck Include default menu as submenu
- ← Back navigation between hub and pages
- HiDPI / Retina gfx scaling for crisp UI on M3 Mac
- LiveProfessor 2–style Cue List, Navigator, Live Mode, Global Snapshots
- Snapshot recall stores full FXCHAIN; params auto-rebuilds
- 1:1 channel creator, custom MIDI/OSC mapping
- ReaPack metapackage under `Live/ReaProfessor.lua` (auto-publish workflow remains disabled)

```bash
./tools/link_to_reaper.sh
